# Unity RPG Course - Part 2

Section 4 - The toughest, and most rewarding section of the course. Here you learn to finish strong, with clean code, few bugs, and great features. This is real game dev right here.

The full [Unity RPG](http://gdev.tv/rpggithub) course is part of a Kickstarter campaign which was over 200% funded. You will benefit from the fact we have already taught over 360,336 students game development, many shipping commercial games as a result.

You're welcome to download, fork or do whatever else legal with all the files! Please note that some sections contain assets with commercial use restrictions. The real value is in our huge, high-quality online tutorials that accompany this repo. You can check out the course here: [Unity RPG]( http://gdev.tv/rpggithub)
